Knowledge Graph Statistical Summary
-----------------------------------
Total nodes: 434 
  Variants=58, Mutations=304, 
  Genes=22, Lineages=35
Total edges: 1206

Top 5 Genes by Mutation Count:
S        128
ORF1a     73
ORF1b     30
N         18
ORF8      16

Average mutation frequency across variants: 2.88

Observations:
• The Spike (S) and ORF1a/b genes form the largest mutational hubs, consistent with known SARS-CoV-2 variability.
• Conserved genes such as E, ORF6, ORF7a/b, and M exhibit fewer mutations, reflecting structural and functional stability.
• The network topology follows a hierarchical Variant → Mutation → Gene pattern, capturing both shared and unique variant features.
• Mutational density within S and ORF1a/b aligns with known selective pressures on spike binding and replication machinery.
• The reconstructed knowledge graph can support downstream tasks such as mutation-based lineage classification or feature embedding.
